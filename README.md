# Power BI course outline


## First Session

### Time and date: 
14th of April 2022 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm

### Goal: 
Getting to know the student, Introduction of the course, Game plan.

### Session outcome:

Lecturer comment;
As you might already know, there is no one perfect way of dealing with data, and that data comes in different  shapes, sizes, and formats. So, it very common to get stuck when working with data regardless of experience or skills you might have.

In our previous session I was grateful that you had your Power BI already installed on your computer, and I appreciated your familiarity with data concepts and techniques. 

You might 've noticed that I did not open once the PDF that contains our course; well, you gonna have to get used to that. This is because I will be expecting you to read your material. So on top of the homework that I will be asking you to do, consider reading the course pdf as your homework by default because i will be assuming some knowledge and familiarity with other concepts that are explicitly highlighted in the course curriculum.


Noticed that I had to let you stuck as well while you were demoing. That too, is something that you will need to get used to, and it will hunt you even when you become a professional data scientist or analyst. So developping the "PisnotP PisWdP" attitude is critical (The problem is not the problem. The problem is what you do about the problem).


We went a bit far in our last session that we started already to clean some data. But please don't  get too excited, in our next session we will go a little bit back and master the art of data collection. Sure, you're familiar with some ways to collect data and you did demonstrate that knowledge but Power BI has so many ways to collect data that I judged you are not familiarised with. So ignore the data cleaning for now, read up on data collection with Power BI and format as a way to prepare for our next session. Most of the data we will be playing with tomorrow will come from open source online, and I will be adding some other dataset to our github repo. You can just use the same technique we learn in our last session to download the files from a github repository.

### Goal reach?
yes

### Student commment:
It was a good session today and I look forward to the one planned for Friday afternoon / evening.
I am very happy with things at present. Thank you once again



## Second session

### Time and Date:
18th of April 6:00 pm to 8:00

### Topic:
Get Data from different data sources.

#### Extra resources
Embed a video

### Goal:
Experiment and familirise with different data sources and format.

### Session outcome:
- Lecturer comment
During the session we were able to experiment with different data source and format like xml, excel, csv, and online data source like facebook. We also encountered common challenges that could arise when collecting data and learned how we could debug different errors. 

We were not able to cover all the data source and more important sources like databases and google.

In the next session we will try to identify some other data sources and see how we could connect to those data sources.

- Student comment
I would say that I would like to use the Power BI tool a bit more in the lessons to get more familiarised with it. If there is any data that I need to load or access, please let me know as soon as you can so that I can load it and have it ready before our session.

With regards to tonight, our country is in stage 4 loadshedding, so I will be without power from 18h00-20h30. Meaning the earliest we can have a lesson is from 21h00 tonight which will not work for me.

Can you recommend specific YouTube videos or other resources so that I can continue to build up knowledge with Power BI in the meantime?

### Goal: 
Getting to know the student, Introduction of the course, Game plan.

### Session outcome:

Lecturet comment;
As you might already know, there is no one perfect way of dealing with data, and that data comes in different  shapes, sizes, and formats. So, it very common to get stuck when working with data regardless of experience or skills you might have.


In our previous session I was grateful that you had your Power BI already installed on your computer, and I appreciated your familiarity with data concepts and techniques. 

You might 've noticed that I did not open once the PDF that contains our course; well, you gonna have to get used to that. This is because I will be expecting you to read your material. So on top of the homework that I will be asking you to do, consider reading the course pdf as your homework by default because i will be assuming some knowledge and familiarity with other concepts that are explicitly highlighted in the course curriculum.


Noticed that I had to let you stuck as well while you were demoing. That too, is something that you will need to get used to, and it will hunt you even when you become a professional data scientist or analyst. So developping the "PisnotP PisWdP" attitude is critical (The problem is not the problem. The problem is what you do about the problem).


We went a bit far in our last session that we started already to clean some data. But please don't  get too excited, in our next session we will go a little bit back and master the art of data collection. Sure, you're familiar with some ways to collect data and you did demonstrate that knowledge but Power BI has so many ways to collect data that I judged you are not familiarised with. So ignore the data cleaning for now, read up on data collection with Power BI and format as a way to prepare for our next session. Most of the data we will be playing with tomorrow will come from open source online, and I will be adding some other dataset to our github repo. You can just use the same technique we learn in our last session to download the files from a github repository.

### Goal reach?
yes
